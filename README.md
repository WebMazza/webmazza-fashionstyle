# **WebMazza - Fashionstyle** 👗👠👕👖

<br/>

The project is a _React-built_ clothing e-commerce website.

This project is a React-based website that uses a combination of Tailwind CSS and custom CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly experience for customers. The website allows users to browse different clothing (fetching fake data from [fakestoreapi.com](https://fakestoreapi.com)), view product details, and add and remove items to the cart. 💻 The website is completely responsive and mobile-friendly. The website is navigable and visually appealing thanks to the use of _Tailwind CSS_.

The website is made up of the following components: the _Header_ (with a logo that brings back to the Homepage), the _List of items_ and the _cart_.

**Note**: Buttons to deepen each section have been voluntarily disabled. The buttons will be activated once this project has been expanded to include insights from the other sections.

## Challenges and Learning 🤔

This project helped me to get more confident with _React_ and _Tailwind_, learning how to fetch data from an API website and implement e-commerce functionality in a website such as managing items to a cart.

<br/>

## Future Improvements 🚧

Expand the project by going deeper into each section, add filtering and search functionality, implement a wishlist feature, create a checkout process with additional payment options (using tools such as _Stripe_), store data and implement user authentication (using cloud-hosted database tools, like _Firebase_), add order tracking and add social media sharing and integration.
